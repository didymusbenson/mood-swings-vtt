## Details

### F1 — Future-turn "additional mood" grants are ignored  (🆕)
**What:** Cards that let a player play an extra mood on a *later* turn/round don't
work — when that turn comes around the player still only gets one play.
**Where:** engine turn logic. The active player's play budget (`playsRemaining`)
is reset to 1 at the start of every turn (`resetTurn`), and grants
(`grantAdditionalMood` etc.) only affect the *current* turn — there is no
mechanism to carry a grant into a future turn. This is the documented
"start-of-turn / cross-turn extra play" gap.
**Affected cards:**
- **#125 Joy** — "you may play an additional mood on your next turn" (one-time, self).
- **#120 Generosity** — "an opponent may play an additional mood on their next turn" (one-time, chosen opponent).
- **#124 Hope** — "an additional mood during each of your turns" (recurring while in play).
- **#121 Grace** — "during each of your turns … an additional mood *from the discard pile* if it shares a color with one of your moods" (recurring; also needs the discard-play color-match constraint — separate sub-gap).
- **#135 Hurt Feelings** — 3+‑player only; **out of scope** for the 2‑player MVP.
**Fix approach (for the plan):** add a persistent, serializable per‑player
"pending / recurring extra plays" mechanism that `resetTurn` consults at the
start of each turn — one‑time grants (Joy, Generosity) consumed once; recurring
grants (Hope, Grace) driven by a while‑in‑play hook re-evaluated each turn start.
**Open question:** none blocking — semantics are clear from the card text.
